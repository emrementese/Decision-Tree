# Decision-Tree
Basic Decision Tree with python

Hi everyone !
  
  My name is Emre MENTEŞE and I study Electric - Electronic Engineering at Istanbul Medeniyet University. I would like to share my computer programming project for you. This project was created and given by Dr. Caner Sahin. The project about basic decision tree. Versions of the project designed for C or C++ programming language with dynamic memory but I arranged again for python with multithreading programming. I uploaded a PDF file for decision tree project but this PDF file's language is Turkish. That's why I will explain the project file a little. Please read the readme.txt file in the Decision-Tree file.
  
For you can understand this project, you must know the some python subjects; Basic python information, File operation for python, Object oriented programming for python, Multithreading programming for python and some python modules.

Thanks for read.
