# Decision-Tree
Basic Decision Tree with python

Hi everyone !
  
  My name is Emre MENTEŞE and I study Electric - Electronic Engineering at Istanbul Medeniyet University. I would like to share my computer programming project for you. This project was given by Dr. Caner Sahin. The project about basic decision tree. The project original versions designed for c or c++ programming language with dynamic memory but I again arranged for python with multithreading programming. I uploaded a pdf file for decision tree project but this pdf file's language is Turkish. That's why I will explain the project file a little.
  
So,

  Firstly we will train the decision tree with first data. After that we'll test the decision tree with second data. The data has 3 criterion. We know 2 criterion and we'll guess last criterion.
